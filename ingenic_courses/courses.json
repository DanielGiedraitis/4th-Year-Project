The course has been hands-on and I am confident that I am well placed for most challenges in the future that touch on Law Enforcement, Digital Forensics Investigation and Cybercrime.\" “I graduated while serving as a Criminal Intelligence officer in the Crimes against Children team at INTERPOL. I subsequently went on to become the Assistant Director with responsibility for the Vulnerable communities group which included the Crimes against Children, Human Trafficking and People Smuggling teams. I have no doubt that my masters from UCD assisted in making me a successful candidate for that executive team role and built on other qualifications I already had including a BA (IT) and a diploma in project management. I have also been privileged to be associated with the development of the Masters programme from the very start and building the Online Child Abuse module which I still teach today.  It's a great masters and I highly recommend it to my fellow LEO all around the world.  The team at UCD are very professional and hard working to ensure you have a successful time there and you meet other students from all around the world, forming friendships and bonds that are very helpful in your professional and personal life.” “I originally selected the program as the modules provided very practical application to my current job functions so it made it possible to learn new things that have a direct application to my field. I like the distance learning format as well as the fact that I was able to use several of the things I learned in my current job. I was able to learn different areas of cyber crime investigations that I had not otherwise been exposed to which will certainly help in my current assignment as well as opening up new possibilities in the future.  The exposure to those disciplines has sparked an interest and given me a great foundation on which to build to be more effective in my current position as well as the potential for future opportunities.” “As a direct result of completing the MSc - I was head hunted by 2 Digital Forensics Companies - Cellebrite and MSAB. I decided MSAB was the more exciting opportunity, and I became their Global Project Manager, so not only was it great completing the MSc, it directly led to a new, exciting - and well paid job - a huge thanks to you all.” Jacques was National Manager for Canada Revenue Agency’s computer forensics program before his new job with UNICEF as a computer forensic examiner supporting a team of internal investigators. Jacques says the MSc was a factor in getting this new job. \"Having both the Master's and almost 30 years investigations pushed me ahead of other candidates.\" “The knowledge and experience I gained during the study is still helpful in my daily work. For two years now I have been coordinator of the cybercrime and digital investigation team of the police academy of The Netherlands. The Masters has helped me to establish a big international network which I continue to make use of and expand. This has helped in developing and sharing new knowledge between different countries and cooperating together. UCD was a great platform to start this and still is through the alumni network.\" \"The MSc programme opened so many doors, some I can talk about, others were used as part of investigations in Organised Crime!\" “The UCD MSc enabled me to grow in my career path and 4 years after graduation I switched career from law enforcement to the financial industry where I established a cyber defence centre for a global bank. For the past year I have been head of global security assessments services which includes red teaming.” Whilst studying for the MSc, Damien was in the Military Police where he says “the course really came into its own, allowing me to deliver enhanced in-house cyber investigation training to our Military Police investigators. The MSc not only provided a solid technical foundation for cyber investigations and cyber centric forensic analysis but also the friendships created during the course have stood the test of time. From a professional perspective the ability to access a broad range of technical experts and cyber investigators from across Europe has paid dividends on many occasions and was most beneficial while working abroad with the EU. The professional credibility of the MSc has greatly enhanced the quality of investigations and evidence gathered as a result of computer Forensic Analysis. The course was an excellent addition to my own skill set and the qualification of MSc underpinned the quality and credibility of associated investigations.” As well as UCD faculty, lecturers for this programme include subject experts from industry and law enforcement.
